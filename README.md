# Process Scheduler Simulation in C++ 🔄

This GitHub repository contains a robust process scheduler simulation implemented in C++. The program is designed to handle input files that provide information about processors, including their number and processing algorithms (FIFO, RR, SJF), as well as details about individual processes such as arrival time, CPU time, etc.

## Features 🚀

- **Process Management**: The program manages complexities such as process forking and kill signals within the simulation, ensuring a realistic representation of a process scheduling environment.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts have been incorporated to enhance code modularity and maintainability, making the codebase more scalable and understandable.

- **Data Structures Implementation**: Various data structures, including Linked List, Queue, and Binary Tree, have been utilized and implemented to optimize algorithmic efficiency, contributing to the overall performance of the simulation.

- **Version Control with GitHub**: The project is integrated with GitHub for version control, facilitating collaborative development and ensuring efficient code management. Developers can easily contribute, track changes, and maintain a clear version history.

## Output 📊

The simulation generates comprehensive output files with detailed statistics, including:

- Waiting time ⌛
- Termination time ⏰
- Number of forked processes 🔄
- Processor load 📈
- Utilization 🔄

These statistics provide valuable insights into the performance and behavior of the implemented process scheduler algorithms.

## Getting Started 🛠️
